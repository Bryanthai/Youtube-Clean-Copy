## What is this extension
Whenever you try to share a video by using the share button in Youtube, it adds a source identifier that its only purpose it to collect data. If the link is crawled by a web crawler from Google for example, it now knows that the link is shared from you. And for anyone trying to use the link, now both your accounts are connected, there is very little to no benefits for you to have the source identifier intact when you share the link.

This extension helps you remove them automatically and preserve your privacy.
